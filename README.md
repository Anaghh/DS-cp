# 💰 Cash Flow Simplification - 4 Algorithm Comparison

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **4-person team project** demonstrating how different data structures and algorithms can solve the same problem: **simplifying cash flows in a group of people**.

Given a list of transactions between people, this web application shows how to minimize the number of settlements needed using 4 different algorithms:

1. **Algorithm 1: Greedy Two-Pointer** (Person A)
2. **Algorithm 2: DFS Graph Traversal** (Person B)
3. **Algorithm 3: Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)** (Person C)
4. **Algorithm 4: Min-Heap Priority Queue** (Person D)

Each algorithm uses different data structures learned in a **Data Structures & Algorithms** course.

## 🎯 The Problem

Imagine 5 friends go on a trip where everyone pays for different things. At the end, there are many mutual debts. Instead of asking everyone to pay everyone else, how can we **minimize the number of settlements**?

### Example:
```
Original Transactions:
Alice → Bob: $50
Bob → Charlie: $30
Charlie → Alice: $20

Simplified Settlements:
Alice → Bob: $20
Bob → Charlie: $30
Total: 2 settlements (instead of 3)
```
